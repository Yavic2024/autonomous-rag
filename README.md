# AutoRAG: Autonomous Retrieval-Augmented Generation with GPT-4o

AutoRAG is a Streamlit-based application that enables users to interact with an autonomous Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The assistant can answer questions using both uploaded PDF documents and real-time web search, providing concise and accurate responses.

---

## Features

- **PDF Knowledge Base:** Upload PDF documents to build a personalized knowledge base.
- **Web Search Integration:** Uses DuckDuckGo for real-time web search when answers are not found in the knowledge base.
- **PostgreSQL Vector Database:** Stores and retrieves document embeddings using pgvector for efficient semantic search.
- **OpenAI GPT-4o Integration:** Leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini for advanced language understanding and generation.
- **Streamlit UI:** Simple and interactive web interface for uploading documents and querying the assistant.

## Project Structure

```
autorag.py           # Main Streamlit application
requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
```

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL server (with pgvector extension enabled)
- OpenAI API key

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Yavic2024/autonomous-rag.git
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up PostgreSQL with pgvector**

   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible at the connection string specified in `autorag.py`:
     ```
     postgresql+psycopg://ai:ai@localhost:5532/ai
     ```
   - Install the `pgvector` extension in your database:
     ```sql
     CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
     ```

---

## Usage

1. **Start the Streamlit app**

   ```sh
   streamlit run autorag.py
   ```

2. **Open the app in your browser**

   - Go to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3. **Interact with AutoRAG**

   - Enter your OpenAI API key in the sidebar.
   - Upload PDF documents to build your knowledge base.
   - Ask questions in the main input box.
   - View responses generated by the assistant, which combines knowledge base search and web search.

---

## Configuration

- **Database Connection:**  
  Update the `DB_URL` variable in [`autorag.py`](autorag.py) if your PostgreSQL credentials or host differ.

- **OpenAI API Key:**  
  Required for both embedding and language model queries. Enter it in the sidebar when prompted.

## Dependencies

See [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) for the full list. Key packages include:

- [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [agno](https://github.com/agnodice/agno) (AI agent framework)
- [openai](https://pypi.org/project/openai/)
- [psycopg-binary](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg-binary/)

## Notes

- The assistant first searches the uploaded PDF knowledge base. If no answer is found, it performs a web search.
- All document embeddings and agent state are stored in PostgreSQL using pgvector.
